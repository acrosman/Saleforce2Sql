I welcome contributions large and small, and I'm happy to help new developers gets started working on public code.

If you have a feature idea or discover a bug, please open an issue so I can track what's going on. Before you take on large work for new features it is generally good to get an affirmation that I'm interested in maintaining the new functionality.

When openning pull requests that address an issue, please include a reference to the issue in the comment so anyone else finding the issue knows you're already working on the problem.

Try to make sure your code passes linting before you open your pull request. I have setup ESLint on this project to follow the airbnb standard (with a few tweaks). All the tools you need should be installed by npm when you setup the code base, and any good editor will have support for helping you find and fix errors. If you don't know how to do that, mention that in your comment, along with your editor and OS, and I'll try to find you directions. I'm not a fan on debating standards but I love having them, so I picked a popular one and I'm following. Issues dedicated to debating the merrit of one coding standard vs another will be met with great skeptism. Issues that point out some niggly detail of airbnb is causing needless headaches are welcome.

I want to give contributors as much credit and support as reasonably possible, so I may provide you feedback on your pull request instead of just merging and fixing the issues myself. That's meant to be helpful, but if it gets frustrating please let me know and I'll try to find another way to move it forward.
