# Salesforce2Sql

This is intended to be a tool to generate a SQL schema to match a Salesforce Org Schema.

## Log in

Currently only the standard login is supported, not OAuth2, so you likely will need your [security token](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=user_security_token.htm&type=5).

In the login fields provide your username, password, and security token. If you are logging into a production or trailhead instance you can use the default login URL. If you are logging into a Sandbox use: https://test.salesforce.com.
